# 💧 Flush Foundation
*Restoring Order One Flush at a Time*

## 🧻 MISSION

To clean the clogged pipelines of crypto with love, memes, and laughter.
We are building a world powered by humor, powered by giving, powered by people.

We don’t promise moons. We plant seeds.  
And those who stick around… will laugh, earn, and witness something eternal.

## 🧩 PARTICIPATE TO RECEIVE

The more you pay attention…  
The more you engage…  
The more you hold, share, joke, or simply *vibe*...

The more you’ll receive.

Yes — we airdrop. Yes — we reward.  
But we don’t say when. Or how.

We’re building a story.  
You're either in it… or watching it unfold without you.

## 🐣 HIDDEN PATHS

You’re not reading a whitepaper.

You’re reading a scroll.

And in scrolls, there are secrets.

If you made it this far…  
Send a message to:

📧 `shitoshi.dev@proton.me`  
*Subject line:* `I Saw the Roach Smoke the Roach`

Maybe you’ll get nothing.  
Maybe you’ll unlock a key.

Either way, you’re here now.

## 🌍 THE WORLD WE’RE BUILDING

We are building a living memeverse.  
There are characters you haven’t met.  
Lore you haven’t heard.  
Drops you haven’t dreamed of.

We won't reveal them all today.  
But they’re coming.

One joke at a time.

And when the flood hits…  
you’ll be glad you were here early.

*This isn't a coin. This is a cleanse.*  
**Flush well. Flush often. Flush together.**
